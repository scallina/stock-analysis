# stock-analysis

## Project Overview

This project was initially created to assist my client, Steve with an analysis of several Green stocks' performance over the 2017 and 2018 trading years. 
After the first draft of the project, I refactored existing code to perform more efficiently in the case Steve should want to analyze much larger lists of stocks. 

## Results
